# MCP Test Endpoint Branch

This branch contains a simple implementation of a Message Control Protocol (MCP) endpoint for testing purposes.

## Purpose

The goal of this test branch is to provide a minimal implementation that enables AI agents to ping the conciliator's MCP endpoint. This is intended only for testing connectivity and confirming that external agents can reach the endpoint.

## Implementation

The implementation consists of a single API endpoint that logs to the console when it's accessed:

- **Endpoint**: `/api/v1/ping`
- **Method**: GET
- **Response**: JSON with status, message, and timestamp

## Testing

You can test the endpoint using:

1. **Browser**: Navigate to `https://[your-domain]/api/v1/ping`
2. **curl**:
   ```
   curl https://[your-domain]/api/v1/ping
   ```
3. **Postman**: Create a GET request to the endpoint URL

## Expected Console Output

When the endpoint is accessed, you'll see output similar to this in your server logs:

```
MCP endpoint pinged at: 2025-04-17T14:30:45.123Z
```

## Expected Response

The endpoint returns a JSON response like:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "MCP endpoint is working",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-17T14:30:45.123Z"
}
```

## Next Steps

After confirming this basic endpoint works and AI agents can successfully reach it, we can:

1. Expand the endpoint to include search functionality
2. Add authentication and rate limiting
3. Integrate with existing database/storage systems
4. Implement full MCP specification features

## Important Notes

- This is a test branch only - do not merge to production without further review
- The implementation is intentionally minimal to focus on connectivity testing
- No authentication is implemented in this test version
