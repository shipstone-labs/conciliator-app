# Conciliator App - Current Status

## Overview
This document tracks the current state of development with focus on validated functionality to ensure continuity between work sessions.

**Last Updated:** May 15, 2025 (4th session)

## Validated Functionality
1. **Navigation Component Test IDs**:
   - Added comprehensive test IDs to all navigation elements (PR #117)
   - Confirmed working in both light and dark themes
   - Verified proper structure in HTML manifest (`/public/test-manifest.html`)
   
2. **Add-IP Workflow Testing**:
   - Complete test ID coverage across all steps of the workflow
   - Validated form interactions with proper data attributes
   - Successfully implemented dynamic content indicators (e.g., `file-upload-zone`)

3. **HTML Manifest Structure**:
   - Consolidated test selectors into single HTML manifest
   - Removed deprecated JSON manifest files
   - Structured by functional areas (navigation, forms, dialogs)

4. **Home Pages Test IDs**:
   - Added test IDs to both logged-in and logged-out home pages
   - Fixed `file-upload-zone` implementation in AddStepContent
   - Updated manifest with homePage and welcomePage sections
   - Used consistent naming conventions with `home-` and `welcome-` prefixes

## Current Session Development (Pending Validation)
1. **Account Modal Test IDs**:
   - Added test ID to modal dialog for account settings
   - **STATUS**: Committed in PR #117 but NOT YET VALIDATED with automated tests

2. **Theme Toggle Test ID**:
   - Enhanced theme toggle button with test ID
   - **STATUS**: Committed but NOT YET VALIDATED with automated tests


3. **List2 Table View Implementation**:
   - Created new table-based list view at /list2 route (PR #125)
   - Implemented improved pagination with sliding window
   - Enhanced with responsive layout for mobile devices
   - Added image thumbnails and enhanced status visualization
   - Improved tooltip functionality for longer text content
   - **STATUS**: Merged and deployed to production

4. **List2 UX Improvements**:
   - Enhanced table view with centered image labels (PR #126)
   - Changed 'Name' header to 'Title' for better semantic meaning
   - Improved title and description fields to allow 2-line truncation with ellipsis
   - Added responsive width constraints for mobile devices (iPhone SE)
   - Fixed layout issues for iPad mini
   - Added search functionality with debounced filtering
   - Implemented multi-word search across title and description fields
   - Added search results count indicator
   - Fixed pagination reset on search term changes
   - **STATUS**: PR created (#126), awaiting review

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Merge List2 UX Improvements**:
   - Review and approve PR #126
   - Verify proper rendering across device sizes
   - Ensure CI checks pass before merging

2. **Apply List2 Improvements to Card Grid**:
   - Implement improved pagination from List2 in card-grid component
   - Add enhanced status badges and expiry information to cards
   - Ensure consistent user experience between table and card views

3. **Validate Home Page Test IDs**:

   - Run automated tests to validate new test IDs on home pages
   - Create basic navigation tests for home page elements
   - Verify test ID discovery via the manifest

4. **Expand test ID coverage to List-IP views**:
   - Add test IDs to list view components
   - Ensure proper integration with the test manifest
   - Create consistent naming pattern for list items

5. **Improve test coverage for Details view**:
   - Add test IDs to detail page components
   - Ensure modal dialogs have proper test IDs
   - Add test IDs to transaction history elements

## Running Test Validation
```bash
# View test points manifest directly
open http://localhost:3000/test-manifest.html
```

## Open Questions for Next Session
1. Should we extend the HTML manifest to include dynamic state indicators?
2. Is the current data-testid naming convention sufficient for all components?
3. How should we handle test IDs for dynamically generated content (like lists)?
4. Do we need a documentation page specifically for test automation?
5. Which elements of the List2 implementation should we prioritize for other components?
6. Should we consider additional accessibility enhancements for mobile and tablet users?
7. What additional status information would be valuable to display in the table view?
8. Should we implement any performance optimizations for the list component (like virtualization)?
9. Should we add test IDs for the improved List2 UX elements?
10. Are there other components that could benefit from the multi-line ellipsis pattern?
11. Should we adjust the max width of description text for different screen sizes?
