   - Created persistent state management via localStorage
   - Implemented consistent form validation patterns
   - Fixed import paths and component references
   - Standardized card styling for design consistency
   - Added proper type definitions in lib/types.ts
   - Fixed TypeScript errors and missing icon dependencies
   - **STATUS**: Implementation complete and validated with successful build

5. **Marketing Funnel Implementation**:
   - Initialized marketing funnel structure in /plan directory (PR #129)
   - Implemented homepage with hero section, benefits, service plans, and testimonials
   - Created FunnelSteps and PlanStorage utilities for funnel state management
   - Added progress indicator and shared layout for all funnel pages
   - Designed responsive UI following existing application patterns
   - Added proper test IDs for automated testing
   - **STATUS**: PR created (#129), awaiting validation in deployment preview

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Complete Marketing Funnel Implementation**:
   - Complete remaining funnel pages based on specifications
   - Implement assessment questionnaire with multi-step flow
   - Create plan comparison page with feature tables
   - Implement individual plan detail pages
   - Add FAQ page with expandable sections
   - Ensure responsive design across all pages

2. **Complete Journey Implementation Refinements**:
   - Standardize button styling across journey pages
   - Ensure consistent spacing and layout patterns
   - Improve color usage for better theme integration
   - Extract common UI patterns into reusable components
   - Add appropriate test IDs for automated testing

3. **Apply List View Improvements to Card Grid**:
   - Implement improved pagination from table view in card-grid component
   - Add search functionality to card grid view
   - Add enhanced status badges and expiry information to cards
   - Ensure consistent user experience between table and card views

4. **Consider Route Simplification**:
   - Evaluate renaming list-ip routes to something more intuitive (e.g., /browse, /ideas)
   - Update all navigation references if route names change
   - Ensure backwards compatibility or proper redirects

5. **Expand Test ID Coverage**:
   - Run automated tests to validate new test IDs on home pages
   - Add test IDs to list view components
   - Add test IDs to journey and funnel pages for automated testing
   - Ensure proper integration with the test manifest
   - Create consistent naming pattern for dynamically generated content

## Running Test Validation
```bash
# View test points manifest directly
open http://localhost:3000/test-manifest.html
```

## Open Questions for Next Session
1. Should we extend the HTML manifest to include dynamic state indicators?
2. Is the current data-testid naming convention sufficient for all components?
3. How should we handle test IDs for dynamically generated content (like lists)?
4. Do we need a documentation page specifically for test automation?
5. Which elements of the enhanced list view implementation should we prioritize for other components?
6. Should we consider additional accessibility enhancements for mobile and tablet users?
7. What additional status information would be valuable to display in the table view?
8. Should we implement any performance optimizations for the list component (like virtualization)?
9. Should we add test IDs for the improved list view UX elements?
10. Are there other components that could benefit from the multi-line ellipsis pattern?
11. Should we adjust the max width of description text for different screen sizes?
12. Should we completely replace the card-grid view or maintain both options for users?
13. Is the search functionality sufficient, or should we add advanced filtering options?
14. Should the journey and funnel state be persisted in Firebase instead of localStorage for better cross-device support?
15. How should we handle deep linking into the journey and funnel pages?
16. Is the current form validation pattern reusable for other forms in the application?
17. Should we add animation transitions between journey steps?
18. Should we make the funnel assessment results persist beyond the session?
19. Should we implement a shared FunnelContext or stick with decentralized storage?
20. Should the funnel pages be auth-gated or freely accessible for marketing purposes?
