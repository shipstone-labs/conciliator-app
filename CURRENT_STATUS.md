# Conciliator App - Current Status

## Overview
This document tracks the current state of development with focus on validated functionality to ensure continuity between work sessions.

**Last Updated:** May 9, 2025

## Validated Functionality
1. **Cypress Test Implementation**:
   - Added simple Cypress test for counting ideas on list page
   - Created configuration to test against production or custom URLs
   - Implemented convenient runner script and documentation
   
2. **Navigation Component Test IDs**:
   - Added comprehensive test IDs to all navigation elements (PR #117)
   - Confirmed working in both light and dark themes
   - Verified proper structure in HTML manifest (`/public/cypress-test.html`)
   
2. **Add-IP Workflow Testing**:
   - Complete test ID coverage across all steps of the workflow
   - Validated form interactions with proper data attributes
   - Successfully implemented dynamic content indicators (e.g., `file-upload-zone`)

3. **HTML Manifest Structure**:
   - Consolidated test selectors into single HTML manifest
   - Removed deprecated JSON manifest files
   - Structured by functional areas (navigation, forms, dialogs)

4. **Home Pages Test IDs**:
   - Added test IDs to both logged-in and logged-out home pages
   - Fixed `file-upload-zone` implementation in AddStepContent
   - Updated manifest with homePage and welcomePage sections
   - Used consistent naming conventions with `home-` and `welcome-` prefixes

## Current Session Development (Pending Validation)
1. **Account Modal Test IDs**:
   - Added test ID to modal dialog for account settings
   - **STATUS**: Committed in PR #117 but NOT YET VALIDATED with Cypress tests

2. **Theme Toggle Test ID**:
   - Enhanced theme toggle button with test ID
   - **STATUS**: Committed but NOT YET VALIDATED for theme switching tests

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Validate Home Page Test IDs**:
   - Run Cypress tests to validate new test IDs on home pages
   - Create basic navigation tests for home page elements
   - Verify test ID discovery via the manifest

2. **Expand test ID coverage to List-IP views**:
   - Add test IDs to list view components
   - Ensure proper integration with the test manifest
   - Create consistent naming pattern for list items

3. **Improve test coverage for Details view**:
   - Add test IDs to detail page components
   - Ensure modal dialogs have proper test IDs
   - Add test IDs to transaction history elements

## Running Test Validation
```bash
# Local testing via safeidea-tester (recommended)
cd /Users/creed/projects/safeidea-tester
npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/add-idea-to-safeidea.cy.js --env url=http://localhost:3000

# View test points manifest directly
open http://localhost:3000/cypress-test.html
```

## Open Questions for Next Session
1. Should we extend the HTML manifest to include dynamic state indicators?
2. Is the current data-testid naming convention sufficient for all components?
3. How should we handle test IDs for dynamically generated content (like lists)?
4. Do we need a documentation page specifically for test automation?
5. Should we expand the Cypress tests to cover additional key user flows?
6. How can we integrate the idea count test into CI/CD pipeline?
