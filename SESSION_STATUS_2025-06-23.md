# Session Status Report - June 23, 2025

## Session Summary

### Objective
Fix the FEATURES environment variable filtering issue that prevented it from being passed to the client side in PR preview deployments, causing feature flags to not work properly.

### Work Completed

#### 1. Environment Variable Fix Implementation
Successfully fixed issue #159 by adding 'FEATURES' to the environment variable allowlist:
- **File Modified**: `lib/getServerConfig.ts`
- **Change**: Added 'FEATURES' to the includes array in `reformatEnvironment()` function
- **Branch**: `fix/features-env-var-filtering`
- **PR**: #160 created and linked to issue #159

**Technical Details:**
- The `reformatEnvironment()` function filters which environment variables get passed from server to client
- Previously only allowed: variables starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, `FILCOIN_CONTRACT`, and explicitly listed ones
- FEATURES was missing from the explicit list, causing it to be filtered out

#### 2. Comprehensive Testing of the Fix
Conducted thorough testing to verify the fix works correctly:

**Test Results:**
- ✅ FEATURES env var is successfully passed in `/api/config` response
- ✅ Standard site receives: `"stripe.stytch.lit.lilypad.openai.storacha.firestore.firebase.bucket.net"`
- ✅ AI site receives: `"stripe.stytch.lit.lilypad.openai.storacha.firestore.firebase.bucket.ai"`
- ✅ Different deployments correctly receive different FEATURES values
- ✅ Confirmed the code uses env var instead of URL fallback

**Key Discovery:**
- The vocabulary system shows mixed results because it's only implemented on some pages (home-app, welcome-home)
- Subscription pages still have hardcoded text and don't use vocabulary yet
- This is unrelated to the env var fix

#### 3. Issue Resolution
- Closed issue #159 with detailed explanation and reference to PR #160
- Confirmed the fix eliminates the need for URL-based fallback detection

#### 4. PR Review Specification Updates
Enhanced the PR Review Specification based on testing experience:
- Added browser management best practices in Phase 3
- Created new "Testing Hints" section with:
  - Browser connection management (avoid stuck connections)
  - JavaScript evaluation tips (explicit returns required)
  - Environment variable testing guidance
- Removed specific PR examples to keep document focused on general guidance

### Technical Issues Encountered

#### 1. MCP Puppeteer Connection Issues
**Problem**: Connection to Chrome would get stuck indefinitely, even after browser actions completed
**Root Cause**: Known issue with MCP client-server communication (similar to GitHub issue #835)
**Solution**: Always close browser between tests instead of waiting for stuck connections

#### 2. JavaScript Evaluation Returns
**Problem**: `puppeteer_evaluate` returning undefined
**Root Cause**: Missing explicit `return` statements in JavaScript code
**Solution**: Always use `return` for expressions in puppeteer_evaluate

#### 3. Browser State Management
**Problem**: Multiple Chrome instances and windows accumulating
**Root Cause**: Incomplete cleanup between tests
**Solution**: Use `pkill -f "Google Chrome"` for complete cleanup, verify port is free

### Architecture Insights

#### 1. Environment Variable Flow
- Server-side: `getServerConfig.ts` filters env vars in `reformatEnvironment()`
- Client-side: Config accessed through React context via `useConfig()` hook
- Feature detection: `useFeature()` hook checks FEATURES string for specific features

#### 2. Multi-Site Deployment
- Each deployment has its own FEATURES configuration
- Standard site: ends with `.net`
- AI site: ends with `.ai`
- This determines vocabulary, routing, and feature availability

### Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Complete Vocabulary Implementation**:
   - Subscription pages need vocabulary system applied
   - FAQ content needs architectural changes to use vocabulary

2. **Monitor PR #160**:
   - Ensure deployment succeeds
   - Verify fix works in production environments

3. **Documentation**:
   - Consider documenting the environment variable flow in project docs
   - Add troubleshooting guide for common MCP Puppeteer issues
