# Session Status - June 13, 2025

## Overview
Created and tested an automated Add-IP script for SafeIdea.net using MCP Puppeteer integration.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. MCP Puppeteer Setup
- Successfully connected to Chrome browser with remote debugging enabled
- Tested navigation and interaction capabilities with SafeIdea.net
- Confirmed ability to take screenshots and interact with page elements

### 2. Add-IP Script Documentation
- Created comprehensive Add-IP script (`/test/claude-sdk-mcp/add-ip-script.js`) with 5 steps:
  1. Find and click Add Idea button
  2. Fill Public Title with randomly generated invention
  3. Fill Public Description with contextual sentences
  4. Create and upload MD file with detailed documentation
  5. Click Create Your Idea Page button

### 3. Title Generation Enhancement
- Implemented proper title case formatting with connector word exceptions
- Added profession-specific outcomes to avoid repetitive "Enhanced Performance"
- Examples:
  - "A Chef's Blockchain System Using Neuroscience for Culinary Innovation"
  - "A Designer's AI System Using Neuroscience for Creative Workflow"
  - "A Farmer's Blockchain System Using Genetics for Crop Yield"

### 4. Automated Script Creation
- Created fully automated version (`/test/claude-sdk-mcp/add-ip-automated.js`)
- Discovered hidden file input element with `data-testid="file-upload-input"`
- Implemented direct file upload approach (though browser security limits actual automation)

### 5. Script Testing
- Successfully executed multiple test runs
- Generated various invention titles and descriptions
- Created detailed MD files with 8-paragraph documentation
- Confirmed all form filling works correctly

## Issues Encountered

### Upload File Button Issue
- The "Upload File" button appears to be non-clickable in current deployment
- Modal dialog not appearing when button is clicked
- This prevents completion of the automated flow
- Issue persists even after logout/login

## Generated Files
- `/test/claude-sdk-mcp/add-ip-script.js` - Main script documentation
- `/test/claude-sdk-mcp/add-ip-automated.js` - Automated runner script
- `/test/claude-sdk-mcp/generated/ip-chef-blockchain.md` - Example generated IP file
- `/test/claude-sdk-mcp/generated/ip-farmer-blockchain-genetics.md` - Example generated IP file  
- `/test/claude-sdk-mcp/generated/ip-designer-ai-neuroscience.md` - Example generated IP file

## Key Learnings

1. **MCP Puppeteer Integration**: Works well for browser automation with Claude
2. **Title Generation**: Context-aware outcomes make generated titles more realistic
3. **File Upload Automation**: Hidden input elements can potentially bypass modal dialogs
4. **Script Reusability**: Well-documented scripts enable rapid iteration and testing

## Next Steps

1. Investigate the Upload File button issue - may need to check PR deployment
2. Test the automated script with working file upload
3. Consider adding more profession/technology/science combinations
4. Explore automating other SafeIdea workflows

## Technical Notes

- MCP Puppeteer requires Chrome to be started with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`
- File inputs cannot be programmatically set due to browser security (need user interaction)
- The app uses hidden file inputs that could potentially be automated with proper Playwright setup
- Title case function properly handles connector words (for, and, with, etc.)

## Session Duration
Approximately 2 hours of development and testing.
