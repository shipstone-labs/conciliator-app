# Session Report - June 16, 2025 (Session 3)

## Session Overview
- **Duration**: ~45 minutes
- **Branch**: `add-ip-update` (PR #146)
- **Objectives**: 
  - Fix file upload restrictions and size limits
  - Update Guard page messaging from AI sales to IP protection

## Work Completed

### 1. File Upload Component Updates (`/components/AddIP/AddStepContent.tsx`)

#### File Size Limit
- **Changed**: 2MB → 20MB
- **Rationale**: Users need to upload larger documents for IP protection

#### File Type Restrictions
- **Initial approach**: Accept all files, mention ZIP for multiple files
- **Issue discovered**: `readAsText()` would corrupt binary files
- **Final solution**: Restrict to text-based formats only
  - Markdown (.md, .markdown)
  - HTML (.html, .htm)  
  - Text (.txt)
- **Technical reason**: These formats work with existing text processing pipeline

#### Modal Text Updates
- **Old**: "Select a text or markdown file containing your idea description. This file will be encrypted and stored securely."
- **New**: "Upload a Markdown, HTML, or Text file. Note that only one file is accepted per IP. The file can be up to 20MB. Your file will be encrypted and stored securely."

#### Impact Analysis
Traced the file handling through the codebase:
- `readAsText()` expects UTF-8 text
- Content stored in sessionStorage as string
- Encryption uses `TextEncoder`
- Downsample function processes text with numbers
- All compatible with text-based files only

### 2. Guard Page Rebranding

#### Terminology Changes
- "AI Guard" → "Guard" throughout
- "AI Protection" → "Guard Protection"
- "AI Agent" → "Guard Protection"
- Removed all AI sales/marketing references

#### Content Refocus
Shifted from sales agent concept to IP protection service:

**Old Focus**: 
- Smart Matching (finding partners/investors)
- Automated Outreach (responding to inquiries)
- Engagement tracking

**New Focus**:
- **24/7 Monitoring**: Patent databases and publication scanning
- **Periodic Reports**: Alerts with detailed comparisons
- **Legal Documentation**: Evidence collection for enforcement

#### Updated Messaging
- Header: "Enable automated monitoring, reporting, and enforcement"
- Benefits focused on protection, not promotion
- Detailed list emphasizes legal audit trails and enforcement support

### 3. Code Quality
- All changes properly formatted with Biome
- Consistent styling maintained
- No TypeScript errors introduced
- Shared component updates affect both old and new flows

## Technical Decisions

### File Type Restriction Rationale
After analyzing the code path, restricting to text-based files was necessary because:
1. Binary files would be corrupted by `readAsText()`
2. SessionStorage can only store strings
3. The encryption and downsample functions expect text
4. No changes needed to downstream processing

### Guard Messaging Strategy
The new messaging better aligns with:
- Core value proposition of IP protection
- Legal/professional audience expectations
- Clearer differentiation from generic AI features
- Focus on concrete deliverables (reports, documentation)

## Results
- ✅ File upload now accepts appropriate file types up to 20MB
- ✅ Clear user guidance on file requirements
- ✅ Guard page messaging aligned with protection focus
- ✅ All text changes maintain professional tone
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps
1. Test file uploads with various text formats
2. Verify 20MB files work across browsers
3. Consider adding more text formats if requested (e.g., .rtf, .csv)
4. Implement external legal document upload (TODO in code)
5. Add Guard feature documentation for users
