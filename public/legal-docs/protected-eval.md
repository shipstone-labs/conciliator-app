# INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EVALUATION AGREEMENT (SafeIdea Platform)

This Agreement is effective when you, the Evaluator, click "I Agree" below ("Effective Date"). This is a binding contract between:

**The Discloser:** The entity making the Intellectual Property available to you via the SafeIdea platform for evaluation. The Discloser represents that it has the necessary rights from the creator and/or owner of the Intellectual Property to do so.

and

**You, the Evaluator:** The individual or entity evaluating the Intellectual Property.

By clicking "I Agree," you agree to the terms below regarding your access to valuable Intellectual Property and Confidential Information provided by the Discloser through the SafeIdea platform.

**1. The Important Stuff (Definitions):**

* **Intellectual Property:** The protected creations (inventions, designs, software, etc.) originally conceived by a creator and owned by an owner (who may or may not be the same as the Discloser), and which the Discloser is making available via SafeIdea.
* **Confidential Information:** All private information shared about the Intellectual Property, whether marked confidential or obviously sensitive. This does NOT include info you already knew, that's public (not your fault), or you developed independently.
* **SafeIdea Platform:** The secure system (using decentralized encryption) the Discloser uses to let you access the Intellectual Property.
* **Purpose:** To evaluate the Intellectual Property for a potential license from the Discloser.
* **Access Period:** Your limited time to access the Intellectual Property on SafeIdea, shown in the platform.
* **Protected Evaluation Model:** The Discloser's system using SafeIdea for secure evaluation, including identity check and recording.
* **Evaluation Record:** SafeIdea's digital log of your agreement, access, and interaction.
* **Immutable Record:** A permanent, public digital log on SafeIdea for non-sensitive transaction details.

**2. Access & Your Responsibilities:**

You get limited access to the Intellectual Property on SafeIdea only for the Purpose and during the Access Period. SafeIdea will record your activity for the Evaluation Record.

You agree to:
* Keep all Confidential Information secret.
* Use Confidential Information ONLY for the Purpose.
* Not share Confidential Information with anyone else unless the Discloser approves in writing.
* Not copy, reverse engineer, or try to figure out the Intellectual Property's secrets.
* Limit who on your team sees Confidential Information and ensure they keep it secret too.
* Tell the Discloser immediately if Confidential Information is misused or leaked.
* Stop using Confidential Information and delete/return copies when your access ends or the Discloser asks.

**3. Your Identity & The Record:**

To use the Protected Evaluation Model, you must verify your identity. Evidence of this is linked to your access and the Evaluation Record within SafeIdea. Your personal identity information is kept private according to privacy laws (like US laws, including CCPA) and the Discloser's Privacy Policy â€“ it is not made public.

**4. Public Immutable Record (Non-Confidential):**

You agree that certain non-confidential details from your Evaluation Record will be put on a public Immutable Record via SafeIdea.

* **What's Recorded:** Only non-private transaction facts: a transaction ID, date/time of the event, a non-identifying reference to the Intellectual Property (like a secure, non-revealing code provided by the Discloser), and indicators confirming this evaluation happened under the Protected Evaluation Model. Your name and personal details are NOT on this public record.
* **Why:** To create a transparent, verifiable history of evaluations on SafeIdea, showing that the process is being followed under the Protected Evaluation Model.
* **Permanent:** Once recorded, this information cannot be changed or removed.

**5. No Rights or Licenses (Just Looking):**

This Agreement is for evaluation only. You are not getting any ownership or license rights to the Intellectual Property or Confidential Information through this Agreement.

**6. End of Obligations:**

Your obligations regarding Confidential Information end five (5) years after the Effective Date, unless specific Confidential Information qualifies as a trade secret under applicable law (which may have longer protection).

**7. What Happens if You Break This Agreement:**

Breaking this Agreement could cause the Discloser serious harm that money can't fix. The Discloser can seek immediate legal action (like an injunction) to stop you, in addition to other legal rights they have.

**8. Legal Details (Philadelphia, PA, USA):**

This Agreement is governed by and interpreted under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, United States, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Any legal actions or proceedings arising from this Agreement will be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

**9. The Whole Agreement:**

This is the complete agreement between you and the Discloser about evaluating the Intellectual Property through SafeIdea. It replaces any other conversations or agreements about this specific evaluation. Your use of SafeIdea is also subject to the SafeIdea platform's terms of service.

**10. Signing Electronically:**

By clicking "I Agree," you are signing this Agreement digitally. This is legally binding, just like a physical signature.

**BY CLICKING "I AGREE," YOU CONFIRM YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO EVERYTHING ABOVE, INCLUDING THE SAFEIDEA PLATFORM'S ROLE, IDENTITY VERIFICATION, RECORDING YOUR ACTIVITY, AND THE PUBLIC (BUT PRIVATE-DATA-FREE) IMMUTABLE RECORD.**
