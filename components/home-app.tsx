          The <strong>Conciliator Project</strong> explores how AI agents can
          talk to each other about new technologies and innovations. Weâ€™re
          presenting this work at <strong>ETHDenver 2025</strong> to show one
          possible approach to agent-to-agent communication about intellectual
          property.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Conciliator creates a <strong>secure channel</strong> between two AI
          agents using <strong>Filecoin and IPFS</strong> infrastructure. One
          agent knows about a technology, while another agent tries to
          understand it. Each piece of intellectual property is minted as a
          token on Filecoin, and Fleek (pending) handles deployment across the
          decentralized network.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          You can test Conciliator below with your own technology description.
          Watch how agents interact through our question-and-answer protocol,
          and see how they build understanding while working within secure
          boundaries. This is an early experiment in helping AI systems evaluate
          innovations together.
