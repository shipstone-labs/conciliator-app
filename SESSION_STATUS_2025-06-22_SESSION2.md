# Session Status Report - June 22, 2025 (Session 2)

## Session Summary

### Objective
Test the vocabulary system implementation from the previous session and complete the FAQ page vocabulary integration.

### Work Completed

#### 1. PR Testing of Vocabulary Implementation
Successfully tested all 5 subscription pages that were updated in the previous commit:
- `/subscription/plans` - Verified "Creative Protection" vs "IP Protection" terminology
- `/subscription/basic` - Verified "Idea Protection" vs "IP Protection" terminology  
- `/subscription/secure` - Confirmed vocabulary working correctly
- `/subscription/complete` - Confirmed vocabulary working correctly
- `/subscription/how-it-works` - Verified "creative ideas" vs "intellectual property" terminology

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ All vocabulary implementations working correctly on both site variants
- ✅ URL-based detection functioning properly for PR preview deployments
- ✅ Build deployed successfully with no errors

#### 2. PR Review Specification Updates
Enhanced the PR Review Specification document with lessons learned from testing:
- Added Phase 3.5: Test Coverage Verification
- Added Phase 4: Visual Testing Protocol
- Enhanced Testing Hints Knowledge Base with:
  - Verifying Expected Behavior guidelines
  - When Things Don't Match Expectations procedures
  - Testing Efficiency tips
- **Critical Addition**: Emphasized Chrome cleanup in Step 5 with verification

#### 3. FAQ Page Vocabulary Implementation
Partially implemented vocabulary support for the FAQ page:
- ✅ Added vocabulary import and hook
- ✅ Updated UI text to use vocabulary:
  - Page subtitle: `getTerm('faq.subtitle')`
  - Contact section: `getTerm('faq.contact.description')`
  - CTA section: `getTerm('faq.cta.ready')` and `getTerm('faq.cta.start')`
- ❌ FAQ content itself still uses hardcoded "intellectual property" terminology

**Technical Discovery:**
- FAQ_CATEGORIES is defined outside the component, preventing use of getTerm() hook
- The filteredFAQs search functionality was already properly implemented and working
- Decision made to leave FAQ content hardcoded for now, only updating UI text

### Technical Issues Encountered

#### 1. FAQ Page Refactoring Attempt
Initially attempted to move FAQ_CATEGORIES inside the component to enable vocabulary usage, which led to:
- Duplicate export statements error
- Missing filteredFAQs state confusion
- Linting errors about useEffect dependencies

**Resolution:** Reverted to original structure and applied vocabulary only to UI text elements.

#### 2. Understanding filteredFAQs
Initially thought filteredFAQs was missing, but discovered:
- It was properly implemented in the original code
- Provides search functionality for FAQ items
- Filters based on question OR answer text containing search term
- No fix was needed - it was working correctly

### Architecture Insights

#### 1. Vocabulary System Limitations
- Vocabulary can only be used within React components (needs hooks)
- Content defined outside components cannot use getTerm()
- This affects FAQ_CATEGORIES and similar static data structures

#### 2. Neutral Terminology Strategy
The vocabulary system includes neutral FAQ entries (e.g., `faq.neutral.safeidea.description`) that use "IP / Ideas" terminology, but these aren't being utilized because the FAQ content is hardcoded.

### Work Not Completed

#### 1. Full FAQ Content Vocabulary
The FAQ questions and answers still contain hardcoded "intellectual property" references instead of using the neutral vocabulary entries. This would require architectural changes to move FAQ_CATEGORIES inside the component.

#### 2. Testing of FAQ Changes
Did not test the FAQ page changes in the browser before committing.

### Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Consider FAQ Architecture Refactor**: 
   - Move FAQ_CATEGORIES inside component as useMemo
   - Apply vocabulary to all FAQ content
   - Or create a separate FAQ data file that can be imported with vocabulary applied

2. **Test Remaining Pages**:
   - Test the FAQ page changes once deployed
   - Implement vocabulary for other public pages (home, list-ip, etc.)

3. **Documentation Update**:
   - Remove "Do not attribute Claude" from CLAUDE.md as requested

## Session Metrics
- Files modified: 2 (PR spec doc, FAQ page)
- Vocabulary implementations tested: 5 pages
- Partial vocabulary implementation: 1 page (FAQ)
- Documentation updates: 1 major (PR Review Specification)

## Git Status at Session End
- Branch: `feat/vocabulary-subscription-pages`
- Modified files: `app/subscription/faq/page.tsx`, `docs/PR_REVIEW_SPECIFICATION.md`
- Ready to commit FAQ changes and push to origin
