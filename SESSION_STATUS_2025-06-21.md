# Session Status Report - June 21, 2025

## Session Overview
Fixed critical issues with the FAQ page and created development utilities for MCP Puppeteer testing.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed GitHub MCP Server
- **Issue**: Multiple GitHub MCP Docker containers were running
- **Resolution**: Stopped old containers and verified configuration
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

### 2. Fixed FAQ Contact Support Button
- **Issue**: Contact Support button was navigating to non-existent `/contact` route, triggering authentication requirement
- **Root Cause**: No `/contact` page exists in the application
- **Resolution**: Changed button to use `mailto:info@safeidea.ai` link
- **Location**: `/app/subscription/faq/page.tsx` line 381-383
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

### 3. Updated File Size Documentation
- **Issue**: FAQ incorrectly stated 100MB per document limit
- **Resolution**: Updated to reflect actual limits:
  - 20MB combined file size per IP
  - Multiple files can be added per IP
  - Enterprise clients can request higher limits
- **Location**: `/app/subscription/faq/page.tsx` line 148
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

### 4. Added MCP Puppeteer Test Helpers
- **Created Files**:
  - `test/claude-sdk-mcp/auth-helper.js` - SafeIdea authentication flow helper
  - `test/claude-sdk-mcp/hamburger-menu-test.js` - UI interaction testing for Radix UI components
  - `test/claude-sdk-mcp/test-hamburger-fix.js` - Interactive test script for menu interactions
- **Updated**: `.gitignore` to exclude puppeteer log files (`logs/mcp-puppeteer-*.log*`)
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

## Pull Requests Created

### PR #154: Fix FAQ contact button and update file size limits
- **URL**: https://github.com/shipstone-labs/conciliator-app/pull/154
- **Branch**: `chore/add-test-helpers`
- **Status**: Open and ready for review
- **Changes**:
  - FAQ contact button fix (mailto link)
  - File size documentation update
  - Test helper files for MCP Puppeteer
  - Gitignore update for log files

## Technical Notes

### Authentication Issue Root Cause
The Contact Support button was trying to navigate to `/contact` which doesn't exist in the Next.js app. When Next.js encounters a non-existent route, it appears to trigger some authentication logic, possibly through error handling or a catch-all route. The fix uses a simple mailto link which bypasses routing entirely.

### File Organization
- Test helpers are in `test/claude-sdk-mcp/` directory
- These files provide utilities for automated testing with MCP Puppeteer
- The auth helper handles login flows with fallback for manual intervention
- The hamburger menu test files address challenges with Radix UI dropdown components

## Next Steps (Recommended)
1. Review and merge PR #154
2. Consider creating a proper contact page if more complex contact functionality is needed
3. Update any other references to `/contact` route if they exist elsewhere
4. Consider adding automated tests using the new test helpers

## Session Summary
Successfully resolved two user-facing issues (contact button requiring login and incorrect file size documentation) and added development utilities for future testing. All changes have been properly tested, linted, and submitted for review.
