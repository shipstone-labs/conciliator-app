# Welcome to SafeIdea (Formerly Known as Conciliator) Project

SafeIdea is an open source project designed to support creators and inventors of digital content. While copying is inevitable in the digital realm, we want to provide a framework for makers to benefit from their work.

Our design encrypts digital IP and enables secure sharing, giving creators control over their content. We're also developing tools to improve content discovery and streamline transactions, making it easier for users to find and access digital creations legitimately.

This is a new project, and we're actively seeking community feedback on our approach. We believe there's a significant need for this solution - especially for intellectual property, which is our primary focus. We're building a decentralized ecosystem that respects creator rights while facilitating appropriate sharing and use.
