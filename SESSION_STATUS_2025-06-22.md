# Session Status Report - June 22, 2025

## Session Summary

### Objective
Implement the vocabulary system for subscription pages that work without login, focusing on supporting both safeidea.net (Ideas focus) and app.safeidea.ai (IP focus) deployments.

### Work Completed

#### 1. Vocabulary System Extension
- Added ~70 new vocabulary entries to `lib/vocabulary.ts` covering:
  - Plan titles and descriptions (basic, secure, complete)
  - Protection types and features
  - Call-to-action buttons
  - Use cases and examples
  - FAQ content with neutral "IP / Ideas" terminology
  - Process descriptions for how-it-works page

#### 2. Pages Updated with Vocabulary
Successfully implemented vocabulary in 5 subscription pages:
- `/subscription/basic` - Basic plan ($9/month)
- `/subscription/secure` - Secure plan ($19/month)
- `/subscription/complete` - Complete plan ($29/month)
- `/subscription/plans` - Plan comparison page
- `/subscription/how-it-works` - Process explanation page

#### 3. Technical Issues Resolved
- **TypeScript Scope Issue**: Fixed error where `getTerm` was used outside component scope in plans page
  - Solution: Moved PLANS and FEATURE_INFO arrays inside the component function
- **Formatting Issues**: Resolved Biome formatter complaints about line length
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: All checks now passing (linting, formatting, TypeScript)

#### 4. Key Implementation Details
- Used consistent pattern: `const { getTerm } = useVocabulary()`
- Implemented URL fallback detection alongside env var checking
- Used neutral terms ("IP / Ideas") for FAQ sections to work on both sites
- Maintained all existing functionality while adding vocabulary support

### Work Remaining

#### 1. Additional Subscription Pages (Lower Priority)
- `/subscription/assessment` - Assessment questionnaire (explicitly excluded from this session)
- `/subscription/test` - Test page (explicitly excluded from this session)
- `/subscription/signup` - Signup flow
- `/subscription/success` - Success confirmation page
- `/subscription/faq` - Dedicated FAQ page (if it exists)

#### 2. Other Public Pages Needing Vocabulary
Based on the earlier analysis, these pages still need vocabulary implementation:
- `/` - Home page (partially implemented)
- `/list-ip` - IP listing page
- `/list-ip/mine` - User's own IPs
- `/portfolio-interest` - Portfolio interest page
- `/ai-home` - AI home page

#### 3. Partially Implemented Pages
- `/add-ip` - Has some vocabulary but incomplete
- `/add-ip/protect` - Has some vocabulary but incomplete

### Important Notes for Next Session

#### 1. Testing Recommendations
- Test all updated pages with both URL patterns:
  - safeidea.net URLs should show "Ideas" terminology
  - app.safeidea.ai URLs should show "IP" terminology
  - PR preview URLs (containing 'conciliator-ai') should show "IP" terminology

#### 2. Vocabulary Patterns to Follow
- Always check for existing vocabulary keys before adding new ones
- Use the established naming convention: `context.element.property`
- For neutral terms, return the same value for both `.net` and `.ai`
- Remember to implement URL fallback checking for PR previews

#### 3. Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't use `getTerm` outside of React components (causes scope errors)
- Always run `pnpm format` before committing to fix formatting issues
- Check for TypeScript errors with `pnpm check` before committing
- Remember that some pages require authentication and weren't in scope

#### 4. Architecture Considerations
- The vocabulary system uses both feature flags and URL detection
- URL detection is crucial for PR previews where env vars might not be set
- The pattern is: check feature flag first, then fall back to URL checking

### Commit Information
- Branch: `feat/vocabulary-subscription-pages`
- Commit: `122b3e3` - "feat: implement vocabulary system in subscription pages"
- All pre-commit hooks passed successfully

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Test the implemented pages thoroughly on both deployments
2. Implement vocabulary for remaining public pages (home, list-ip, etc.)
3. Complete vocabulary implementation for add-ip flow
4. Consider creating a vocabulary audit to ensure all hardcoded text is replaced
