# Unfixed Error Handling Issues

This document lists the remaining non-standard error handling issues in the codebase that were not addressed by PR #133. These issues require more careful testing and consideration as they could potentially alter application behavior if modified.

## Remaining Issues by File

### 1. components/DetailIP/index.tsx
1. **Missing validation/error handling for UI failures**: When the component encounters invalid or unexpected data, it may not display appropriate UI feedback to users.
2. **Incomplete state cleanup during errors**: Some error conditions may leave component state in an inconsistent state, which could affect subsequent operations.

### 2. app/subscription/SubscriptionStorage.ts
1. **Incomplete error handling in useState/useEffect React pattern**: Some of the React hooks don't fully handle all potential error conditions, especially around data fetching.
2. **Silent failures (returning null/false without user notification)**: Several functions return null or false on error without providing any user-visible feedback.

### 3. hooks/useIP.tsx
1. **No validation/error handling for malformed data in useIPAudit**: The hook assumes data retrieved will be properly formatted and doesn't handle malformed data gracefully.
2. **Missing null/undefined checks**: Several code paths lack checks for unexpected null or undefined values.

### 4. components/chat.tsx
1. **Promise rejection handling in runDiscoveryCycle**: The complex cycle management could benefit from more robust error recovery, especially when errors occur mid-cycle.

### 5. lib/session.tsx
1. **Missing try/catch in some promise chains**: Some promise chains lack proper error handling, particularly in the constructor and suspendPromise methods.
2. **Incomplete handling of promise rejections**: Some promise rejections might not be properly caught and handled.
3. **Error propagation without proper context**: Errors are sometimes propagated up the chain without adding context about where they occurred.

### 6. app/api/store/route.ts
1. **Missing/improper error handling for storage operations**: The route has incomplete error handling for certain storage operations.

## Considerations for Fixing

These issues require more careful testing before fixing because:
1. They may affect application flow or state management
2. Fixes could potentially change the behavior of the application, especially in edge cases
3. Some involve complex asynchronous operations where simple try/catch additions might not be sufficient
4. Changes to authentication and session error handling could have security implications

## Recommendations

1. Create isolated test cases for each issue before attempting to fix
2. Implement fixes one at a time with thorough testing after each change
3. Consider a gradual rollout approach for session.tsx changes given their critical nature
4. Add monitoring for any changes to error handling in the chat component's cycle management

## Next Steps

Discuss with Andy to determine:
1. Which of these should be prioritized
2. If any of these issues are intentional design decisions
3. Develop a test strategy for safely addressing each issue
